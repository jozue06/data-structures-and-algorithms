# Reverse an Array
We need to take an array, and reverse the elements

## Challenge
The challenge is to take an input array, reverse its elements, and return the reversed elements in a new array

## Solution

# Shift an Array
We need to take an array, and shift it with a new element.

## Challenge
The challenge is to take an input array and an input number, and put the number into the array at the middle, and return the new array with all of the elements of the old array plus the new element at the middle;

# Write a binary Search
We need to take an array, and a search Key and check the array for the search key, return ing its index.

## Challenge
The challenge is to take an input array and an input number, search the array with a binary search (that is faster than a for loop search), if it is there, return its index, if it is not return -1.

# Largest product of 2 adjacent values in a 2D array

We need to take an array, and a search Key and check the array for the search key, return ing its index.

## Challenge
The challenge is to take an input 2d array and check for the largest product of each adjacent

# linked list insertions

We need to build a new linked list, and add functions to insert as certain locations.

## Challenge

create  `append` `prepend` `insertAfter` and `insertBefore` modules that export the respective functions to mess around with our new singly linked list.

I've not coded this one out. only the whiteboard.

# linked list kth from the end

Write a method to find the `val` at k from the end in a linked list

## Challenge

Write a method that takes in a number, using that number, finds the `node` in a linked list at the number from the `end` of the linked list and returns that `node`.

# Linked List Merger
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jozue06/data-structures-and-algorithms.svg?branch=ll_merge)](https://travis-ci.com/jozue06/data-structures-and-algorithms)

Merge two linked list together, but doing a `zipper` merge.


## Challenge

Write a `function` or `method` that takes in two linked lists as `args`. Return 1 linked list with the values of both in offset nodes.
